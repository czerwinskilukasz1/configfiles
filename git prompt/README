You should see a colored prompt showing some info about the current branch.

Steps:

1. Paste text from .bashrc at the end of your .bashrc file.
2. Copy files: .git_prompt and .git_prompt.sh to your profile directory.
3. Restart shell (run /bin/bash or log out and log in).

Now you should see a colorful prompt in every directory and a repo-/branch-specific info when you enter a directory managed by Git.
